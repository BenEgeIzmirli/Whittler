# Whittler

## About

This utility is designed to consume large datasets of results of some sort, and let you qualitatively or quantitatively rule out certain results as irrelevant. In the future I hope to add some sample usage here, but for now, just use the --help command on Whittler.py, and the "help" command in the shell, combined with some trial and error :)

## Prerequisites

This shell has been tested on Python >= 3.6 .

The only nonstandard library required is [pyxDamerauLevenshtein](https://github.com/gfairchild/pyxDamerauLevenshtein), which can be installed via the following command:

```
pip install pyxDamerauLevenshtein
```

Or, alternatively:

```
python -m pip install pyxDamerauLevenshtein
```
